                    <h3>The Timing Problem</h3>
                    <p>Homeowners search for roofers at night — while you're on a job site or at dinner. Your competitor answers in 3 minutes. You call back the next morning. Job already gone.</p>

                    <p>You're on the roof. Phone rings. You ignore it because you're working. That call was a $22,000 job. They're calling your competitor now.</p>

                    <p>Your best work is on your phone. Your competitor's mediocre work is on Google. Guess who gets the call?</p>

                    <p>You've tried marketing before. Spent $3K, got 2 leads, closed zero jobs. Decided marketing doesn't work. It does — you just paid for the wrong system.</p>

                        <p>Most roofing companies set up ads once and forget them. We manage them daily — adjusting bids, testing keywords, optimizing for your best ZIP codes, and tracking every dollar. Plus, we only work with 5 roofers per territory, so we're never bidding against ourselves.</p>
